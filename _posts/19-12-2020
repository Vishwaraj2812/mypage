"Each one of us likes to be the person who stands out from the crowd." said this amazing blog (here)[https://dampdeseiitb.wordpress.com/2020/08/09/competitive-nature-of-iit-bombay-shaunak-joshi/?fbclid=IwAR27DFBD16LUzW43at8xdvzfrkODSKbfq_YJM1LZSeolcXdVQCPWuX5LNZU].
It should ring us with a question. The very logical flaw that people generally oversee. If everyone like to stand out of the crowd, the question is not why cannot they, but the 
question is, "Where does this crowd originate?".

You already are in IIT, you already have stood out of the crowd. So now, it is in your local enviornment where you want to stand out from the crowd, right? As mentioned earlier, 
I aim to question the very existence the of crowd, if nobody wants to be a part of it. Let us try to see why did a crowd form at the very first place. Let us imagine the very first 
batch of IITians, for simplicity we shall take only the batch from one IIT, it doesn't matter which one. Also, we shall assume that they are here to stay for an equal amount of 
time and therefore we shall look only at their actions and achievement while they are here for the time.

## I will not do one thing more than prescribed  
Take the curriculum of IIT as a pathway given to each of them. Assume, not a single person out of the whole batch does anything other than what is expected to do. Sun rises, they 
perform their morning rituals, they have breakfast, go to class, maintain physical health, study (in equal amounts), relax a bit (any action that results in refreshment and adds 
no kind of wealth i.e. financial/emotional/physical...) and sleep. They all formed a crowd, none is unique among them. Do you call this human behavior? NO.  
Every human experiences different thing even when put in same conditions. Therefore, everyone has a unique behavior and thereby actions.

## Evolution takes place

### _In which direction though?_
The next batch comes, they all do the same things, well **except one**. S/he choose to do something different. If it did not work out (did not generate him/her any kind of wealth), 
it will be ignored. People shall gain even more belief in what they were doing. System normalises to the initial one and excludes any kind of so called "failure" element, if observed.

### The direction changes
Now, the thing continues, each year, one or few of them try out different things (whoosh! Now that is humane). So called "failures" are forgotten and excluded of the system. Now, one
fine time, one of them does a thing which results in creation of some kind of wealth to him/her.

The batch comes, people observe that this one did something different which resulted in some addition in his/her life. Some people start to follow the same. By n generation, we have 
nothing but the same scenerio, all of them are now following the same path. Only a new level is achieved, the characteristic of them collectively has stayed the same. There was 
essentially, only a shift in the crowd i.e. from one crowd to another.

### History repeats
Now again, some of them will do different things in order to achieve more, failures will be forgotten, success will be celebrated and followed. Newer and newer crowds start to form.
It is the mere transition from one crowd to another.
