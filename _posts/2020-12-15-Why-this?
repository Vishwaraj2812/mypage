Hi!
At the time of bulding the basic blogs of this website, I answered a reason behind it [here](https://vishwaraj2812.github.io/mypage.github.io/aboutme/). But then I ask myself, is it all? Probably not. There are many factors more than this, this definitely, is one of the reasons though! This is an attempt to dug deep into myself to find the reasons.

I could never do a thing until I have any reason to do it. I felt amazed seeing poeple learning skills like Web development, App development and more, just to add something 
to their skillset. I too, by the peer pressure, tried my hands on Web development and Python, in the month of July '20 I guess. I failed miserably. Of all the possibilities, I'd like to attribute it to my nature. I simply could not learn something since I might use it later on, at some point of life.

It is now when I thought about blogs and writing down what I feel about things around me, that I needed to learn a little bit of web developmet (mind it, I am no expert at this, I just know the very little and the minimum required, for now at least!). This puts me in a virtuous cycle, I learn Web Dev cause I want my website to look better, I want my website to look better cause I've already learnt this much of Web Dev, it is the time to step up! It was all about the one kick I needed. And, **sometimes, it is the only thing you will ever need, you'll thrive out amazingly good!**

Secondly, I have always avoided things I feel uncomfortable about. I do not like to go to a random person and initiate the conversation, where I have now done the most improvement now. I have a huge stage fear (no progress on this yet!), I do not feel very comfortable when it comes to coding. Also, I do not like practicising much and reading things other than textbook. But  
## 1. A good amount of real-world applicable wisdom is available outside the textbooks!  
I am a student of science, I have majorly learnt Maths, Physics, Chemistry and a little bit of Biology as well. Most of these, always have a condition, which might not be real-world for the given solution to work/ hypothesis to be true (but do not disrespect science and engineering, it still does an amazing close approximation to actual world situations!).  
But the world is different, it is full of living creatures, who are even evolving more than their survival instincts, which esentially says, it is very difficult to model them! And thereby, neither can we expect our assumptions/ conditions to be met nor can we expect a closer answer to real world situation.

But, what I have learnt, is that you find an immense amount of wisdom and knowledge in other people's lives. There is a treasure of experiences and stories to read, and so much to gain from each of them. And the best way, economically or in the interest of time, is by books! So I took the oath to read more and more. I'll list down those books here once I feel I have read enough to share ;)

## 2. Practice makes the man perfect.  
As much as I'd like this to be false, it is true indeed. Sadly enough, I never liked practicing. During the times of JEE preparation, while people would be aiming to get 100s of questions correct by having enough practice, I was happy to rather just find an elegant, a beautiful solution to just one problem. That thing seems so wonderful and amazing! But no! It's a strict no, whether you are preparing for any examination or learning anything, don't do this. Definitly, thrive for that elegant and beautiful solution but do not compromise on practice! I have suffered due to it very recently and have been suffering due to it. I aim to improve it as well.


So the things that I have learnt in my ife,
1. ### Find a purpose, it will be easier for you to adopt more skills and knowledge that way
2. ### Practice things as much as you can, do not exhaust yourself doing that but also do not fear because you are bad at it, it'll improve with practice, not with ignorance!
