Hi,  
I'd like to give _a note of caution_, I am only a second-year undergraduate (at the time of writing the first draft, at least). I am 18, am from a mid-sized town. I did not have much of a tale-able experience until I stepped here, at IIT Bombay.
I have minimal experience (which I tend to believe), and my fundae might not be the best. Please don't blame me if things don't work out for you.

So, the first question I'd ask myself is what my fundae in life are? Is it a collection of all the logic behind each step that I took and proved successful? There's a massive issue in this definition, which not many people see.  
It is the very definition of "success" no. I am not even talking about the philosophical shit which everyone talks about, i.e., material success/ spirituality and whatnot! I ask, how do you measure success?

An excellent idea that is useful in engineering, programming, and many more places is to make a simpler model of the problem and use the logic to solve the actual situation. Let us step down a bit; imagine you have a text-book problem, how do you evaluate its success? Perhaps the first idea is if the answer obtained by your solution matches the given answer. Let us dive deep into it.

### Comparing to the ideal answer
You probably would have figured out issues in here. The first one is **there is no model/ideal answer**. Take your example; you'd have different role-models, all of them having a diverse, unique life.
The very point is that no humans experience the same thing even when subjected to the same issues. Thereby we identify the first issue here!  
The second being that even if an answer matches, it is not necessary that you've got it all correct. You made a few mistakes here and there or, in fact, even have just bluffed your way to the answer.
That is very much possible!

So instead, we answer it this way, the solution is a success if "the solution matches the ideal solution,"  
### Comparing the solution
Yet again, we do not have an idea/ model solution to compare things with!  
Another issue, the solution might not be the only one. There may be multiple solutions. For a significant amount of years (>18 for Indians) of your life, the decisions are taken or, at the very least, heavily dependent upon your parents! What if the very first step (which wasn't even by your decision) deviates from the ideal solution? Boom! You're a failure for doing nothing. Nah, that sounds illogical, exactly!

So, we circle back to the issue,
## How do we measure success?

To me, the only way to identify success is to identify and measure (qualitatively/quantitatively) the alternate reality. "What if I had not taken this step? What would the situation be?"
is the question. At most points of your life, this is not possible, only due to the vast number of variables present in human life. You cannot positively say if you would've been worse
or better-off!

But, to me, it doesn't matter; I am against the idea of defining and rationalizing every step of our life. Humans are inherenty irrational. It is okay if there was an ideal solution, and I took two, three, or a hundred steps as long as those were "my" steps. When I make a choice in my life these days, it is "my" choice, which I make consciously (and try not
to be swayed by emotions) and take complete responsibility for. My life has never been very planned. It is a result of the decisions that were not taken at the moment but still
quite spontaneous.

Does this promise success? **No.** Will this promise success to you? Probably not. Do I regret the decisions? Not yet. Does this guarantee that you will not regret the decisions you will take this way? Sorry, cannot guarantee.  
The thing is that philosophy, the idea of life, the fundae are very subjective! A thing that would work out for me might not work out for you, and sadly even, the past does not guarantee the future.
 
 So how does it help me? Up until now, the decisions I have taken this way, there's none which I regret (don't jinx it, please XP). But more than it working out, maybe it has been 
 "me" working out. I accept whatever be the result of my decision (not necessarily wholeheartedly XP). Those steps have added to my life as well made some cuts on some aspects.
 Regardless, in the long run, it doesn't hurt the people around me or me. Since it was my decision, I do not go around blaming/bitching about someone who told me to do so, and it did not
 work out well.
 
 This was the very governing aspect of all the decisions I make.
 Another **note**: This does not mean that you take decision uninformed, ask people whenever you can, but be aware that things are subjective, filter out all the suggestions, mix them
 all together and find your own way!
 
 Thank you very much for reading it.
 Until next time!
