My name is Vishwarajsinh Gohil (yeah, I know that's a long name!). People prefer calling me Vishwa. I'm from Jamnagar, Gujarat. Had there been no COVID-19, woud've been spending a pleasent time in Mumbai! But alas, here I am, not only back to the city but entrapped in the house.

_A note of caution!_  
If you are, even by small chance, impressed by the webpage, you must know that this is just some edits made on a template and I am not very good at coding! So, not the guy whom you'd like to appear in messenger as "Hey man, can I know how did you make your webpage?"

Okay now, what else do you need?

### The boring stuff

I am currently a sophomore undergrad at the [Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/), pursuing B. Tech there as my major. I am also pursuing a minor in Management at [SJM School of Management, IIT Bombay](http://www.som.iitb.ac.in/). Had a pretty normal schooling, neither been a nerd, nor been a stud!

### Why this webpage?
This is December 2020, I am finally done with the 3rd semester (of the 8 I'm supposed to) which was conducted "online".
<br>
I am uninterested in coding, and a few more reasons, due to which I have no winter intern. I tried once, back in July I guess, to learn how to make a webpage, immediately had a huge give-up. Now that I am completely free, I thought to give it a try again, and voila!

A very special thanks to [Aryaman Maithani](https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/). I was inspired by his webpage and learnt how to make one from there itself!

### Contact
You would find my Facebook, Instagram and e-mail at the footer. I'm pretty approachable and do not like to leave people unread. I am also mostly responsive so will respond to you in a short time only.  
Feel free to contact anytime!
